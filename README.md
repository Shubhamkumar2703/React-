# ⚛️ React.js Learning Journey – God-Tier Roadmap

This repository documents my **complete React.js learning journey**, based on the **“GOD-TIER React.js Complete Course”**.  
It includes **concept-wise folders, mini projects, UI exercises, routing examples, API integrations, and state management practice**.

The goal of this repo is to **build strong React fundamentals → advanced concepts → real-world patterns**, with clean, scalable code.

---

## 🚀 What This Repository Covers

- Modern **React (Functional Components + Hooks)**
- Clean **project & folder structuring**
- Hands-on **mini projects & UI builds**
- Real-world **routing, state management & API handling**
- Code written while **actively learning & practicing**
